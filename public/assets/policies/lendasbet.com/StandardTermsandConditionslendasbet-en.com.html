Lendas Bet reserves the right to decide the results of the match if a market is not determined at the start of the match. This rule operates in terms of the normal duration of the match being completed and if no conditions are stated in the market description on the website.

All bets are available until the umpire or official determines the winner. However, there are cases where a player retires. In this situation, all markets determined on the track are settled accordingly and everything else is void and bets are returned to the players.

For the avoidance of doubt, if Team A plays Team B twice, the result of Game 1 will count for bets offered on Game 1 as originally scheduled and the result of Game 2 will count for bets offered on Game 2 as originally scheduled. The 48 hour rule applies (for example, if a football match is interrupted in the second half, first half markets will be settled as normal). For example, in the example above, the markets for the second game are not decided. They will then be canceled and bets will be refunded to customers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"><br>Explanation of specific types of bets. If there is at least one striker when the match is stopped, all bets placed on the first striker will stand and the last will be cancelled. One player will be determined as the winner at any time according to the top scorer market, and other players&#39; bets will be void. Head 2 Head bets: These bets mean the intention to take the highest position, obtain more points or results between two players. Head 2 Head bets will work if both players do their best in the event.

Live bets will work if all participants are actively participating in the event. If there are participants who are not part of the event, all odds placed on other participants will change and be settled with a reduction in odds. The reduction includes the same margin applied to absent participants. If two or more contestants achieve the same result (tie), the applicable odds will be equal to the accepted odds divided by the number of tied contestants (e.g. with equal odds 2.70 and three contestants tied, the final odds will be: 2.70 / 3 = 0.90), unless the official representative chooses only one winner with an additional statistical criterion (eg Reserve markets: These are yellow and red cards.
